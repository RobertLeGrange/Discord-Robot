##  Robot

A bot that runs on Discord that I am creating using Python.

##Installing

I am creating this bot as a fun project for myself to learn python and to help out in a personal Discord server. Because of this it is not designed yet to be used as a general purpose bot. However for documentation purposes below are the installation steps:

 1. **Install Python 3.9 or higher**

I am currently using Python 3.9.12 to develop Robot. Lower and higher versions will likely work however this needs to be confirmed.

2. **Setup a Virtual Environment**

This step is not required but is recommended to manage the packages and python required to run Robot. This can be done using the command 'python -m venv env'. Activating the virtual environment can be done using the command ''.\env\Scripts\activate'.

3. **Install Dependencies**

To install the packages required to use all of Robot's commands type `pip install -U -r requirements.txt`.

4. **Setup Cofiguration**

Create a '.env' file in the root directory to enter your bot's token. This should be entered in the below format:

TOKEN= # your discord bot's token
